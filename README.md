Angular-JSON-Google-Map
=======================

Pulls in JSON data with Angular.JS and displays on a map

  - Will work for any JSON data that has "latitude", "longitude" and "name"
  - Can be altered to work with just about any JSON data
  - Takes "category" from JSON, strips out duplicates, allows selection of items in those categories and only shows those markers
  - Will dynamically zoom and go-to the marker (or group of markers) on the map upon selection
  - Clicking on one name will focus just on that marker
  - Clicking "show all results" will deselect the <select> box and zoom out to show all markers
